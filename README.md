### Why Did I use IPFS?

I wanted to use IPFS to design a simple and fun app where everyone can collaborate, learn about NFTs and experience them directly.

### How it's made?

NFT gift cards application makes use of the following software:

- Polygon Network: the network we deployed the app for faster and chepear transactions.

- NFTStorage: the data is stored on NFTStorage IPFS, the generated hash (CID) will be used to view the details and to retrieve the NFT.

- ​​ NFTPort for multi-chain NFT minting, and data transparency such as distributing rewards and minting the NFT.

* Solidity: Solidity was used for the smart contract together with OpenZeppelin ERC721 for faster development of the smart contract

* Truffle: for local blockchain development

* Frontend: React Js for the frontend, Material-UI, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

# Getting Started
